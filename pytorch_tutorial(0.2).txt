Learning  Pytorch with Examples

1.Numpy introduction

Numpy provides an n-dimensional array object, and many functions for manipulating these arrays. Numpy is a generic framework for scientific computing; it does not know anything about computation graphs, or deep learning, or gradients. However we can easily use numpy to fit a two-layer network to random data by manually implementing the forward and backward passes through the network using numpy operations:

2.Pytorch:Tensors

Numpy is a great framework, but it cannot utilize GPUs to accelerate its numerical computations. For modern deep neural networks, GPUs often provide speedups of 50x or greater, so unfortunately numpy won’t be enough for modern deep learning.

Here we introduce the most fundamental PyTorch concept: the Tensor. A PyTorch Tensor is conceptually identical to a numpy array: a Tensor is an n-dimensional array, and PyTorch provides many functions for operating on these Tensors. Like numpy arrays, PyTorch Tensors do not know anything about deep learning or computational graphs or gradients; they are a generic tool for scientific computing.

However unlike numpy, PyTorch Tensors can utilize GPUs to accelerate their numeric computations. To run a PyTorch Tensor on GPU, you simply need to cast it to a new datatype.

Here we use PyTorch Tensors to fit a two-layer network to random data. Like the numpy example above we need to manually implement the forward and backward passes through the network:

3.Pytorch:Variables and autograd

In the above examples, we had to manually implement both the forward and backward passes of our neural network. Manually implementing the backward pass is not a big deal for a small two-layer network, but can quickly get very hairy for large complex networks.

Thankfully, we can use automatic differentiation to automate the computation of backward passes in neural networks. The autograd package in PyTorch provides exactly this functionality. When using autograd, the forward pass of your network will define a computational graph; nodes in the graph will be Tensors, and edges will be functions that produce output Tensors from input Tensors. Backpropagating through this graph then allows you to easily compute gradients.

This sounds complicated, it’s pretty simple to use in practice. We wrap our PyTorch Tensors in Variable objects; a Variable represents a node in a computational graph. If x is a Variable then x.data is a Tensor, and x.grad is another Variable holding the gradient of x with respect to some scalar value.

PyTorch Variables have the same API as PyTorch Tensors: (almost) any operation that you can perform on a Tensor also works on Variables; the difference is that using Variables defines a computational graph, allowing you to automatically compute gradients.

4.PyTorch:Defining new autograd functions

Under the hood, each primitive autograd operator is really two functions that operate on Tensors. The forward function computes output Tensors from input Tensors. The backward function receives the gradient of the output Tensors with respect to some scalar value, and computes the gradient of the input Tensors with respect to that same scalar value.

In PyTorch we can easily define our own autograd operator by defining a subclass of torch.autograd.Function and implementing the forward and backward functions. We can then use our new autograd operator by constructing an instance and calling it like a function, passing Variables containing input data.

5.TensorFlow:Static Graphs 

PyTorch autograd looks a lot like TensorFlow: in both frameworks we define a computational graph, and use automatic differentiation to compute gradients. The biggest difference between the two is that TensorFlow’s computational graphs are static and PyTorch uses dynamic computational graphs.

In TensorFlow, we define the computational graph once and then execute the same graph over and over again, possibly feeding different input data to the graph. In PyTorch, each forward pass defines a new computational graph.
d 
Static graphs are nice because you can optimize the graph up front; for example a framework might decide to fuse some graph operations for efficiency, or to come up with a strategy for distributing the graph across many GPUs or many machines. If you are reusing the same graph over and over, then this potentially costly up-front optimization can be amortized as the same graph is rerun over and over.

One aspect where static and dynamic graphs differ is control flow. For some models we may wish to perform different computation for each data point; for example a recurrent network might be unrolled for different numbers of time steps for each data point; this unrolling can be implemented as a loop. With a static graph the loop construct needs to be a part of the graph; for this reason TensorFlow provides operators such as tf.scan for embedding loops into the graph. With dynamic graphs the situation is simpler: since we build graphs on-the-fly for each example, we can use normal imperative flow control to perform computation that differs for each input.


PyTorch: Control Flow + Weight Sharing
As an example of dynamic graphs and weight sharing, we implement a very strange model: a fully-connected ReLU network that on each forward pass chooses a random number between 1 and 4 and uses that many hidden layers, reusing the same weights multiple times to compute the innermost hidden layers.

For this model we can use normal Python flow control to implement the loop, and we can implement weight sharing among the innermost layers by simply reusing the same Module multiple times when defining the forward pass.

the code is :

import random
import torch
from torch.autograd import Variable


class DynamicNet(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, D_in, H, D_out):
        """
        In the constructor we construct three nn.Linear instances that we will use
        in the forward pass.
        """
        super(DynamicNet, self).__init__()
        self.input_linear = torch.nn.Linear(D_in, H)
        self.middle_linear = torch.nn.Linear(H, H)
        self.output_linear = torch.nn.Linear(H, D_out)

    def forward(self, x):
        """
        For the forward pass of the model, we randomly choose either 0, 1, 2, or 3
        and reuse the middle_linear Module that many times to compute hidden layer
        representations.

        Since each forward pass builds a dynamic computation graph, we can use normal
        Python control-flow operators like loops or conditional statements when
        defining the forward pass of the model.

        Here we also see that it is perfectly safe to reuse the same Module many
        times when defining a computational graph. This is a big improvement from Lua
        Torch, where each Module could be used only once.
        """
        h_relu = self.input_linear(x).clamp(min=0)
        for _ in range(random.randint(0, 3)):
            h_relu = self.middle_linear(h_relu).clamp(min=0)
        y_pred = self.output_linear(h_relu)
        return y_pred


# N is batch size; D_in is input dimension;
# H is hidden dimension; D_out is output dimension.
N, D_in, H, D_out = 64, 1000, 100, 10

# Create random Tensors to hold inputs and outputs, and wrap them in Variables
x = Variable(torch.randn(N, D_in))
y = Variable(torch.randn(N, D_out), requires_grad=False)

# Construct our model by instantiating the class defined above
model = DynamicNet(D_in, H, D_out)

# Construct our loss function and an Optimizer. Training this strange model with
# vanilla stochastic gradient descent is tough, so we use momentum
criterion = torch.nn.MSELoss(size_average=False)
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=1e-4, momentum=0.9)
for t in range(500):
    # Forward pass: Compute predicted y by passing x to the model
    y_pred = model(x)

    # Compute and print loss
    loss = criterion(y_pred, y)
    print(t, loss.data[0])

    # Zero gradients, perform a backward pass, and update the weights.
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
